TODO:
PHASE 1
	- create a main loop
	- read the input file in the main loop performing the fft per each SAMPLE_RATE bytes read.
	- find a way to understand the resulting peak after the fft execution.
	- convert the peak to a MIDI note index.
	- play the note :D
PHASE 2
	- do everything with 6 input files running a fft thread per each file (think about sync problems too).
	- unstead of reading 6 file, write a server that takes the input bytes as the socket TCP incoming data.
PHASE 3
	- test(); while(!working){ rethink(); test(); } //hoping this is not an infinite loop
